# Restful Forum - React Source Code Submodule

See it in action [here](https://www.sunkenworld.com/restful-forum).

This app is a personal project I made in order to explore REST APIs with React, Redux, MongoDB, Node and React Router. It's designed to have the basic functionality of a traditional web forum but with a more modern aesthetic. It takes the typical MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) message board exercise and adds a layer of depth by allowing a thread of replies for each main post. This small addition increases the complexity considerably. All of the code was written by hand and is tailored to this specific project.

This is just the submodule containing the front-end React 'src' source folder. To see the entire project, go to [this repository](https://github.com/mackenziewritescode/restful-forum).
